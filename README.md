## Thesis

- ![eBPF](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-eBPF-darkblue?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=white&logoSize=100&labelColor=darkred)<br>
Addressing data visibility vulnerabilities among containers running on the same Linux kernel that utilize eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet
Filter). In multi-container environments, shared kernel access can weaken isolation and security, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized containers. The study explores possible attack vectors that leverage eBPF and proposes prototype solutions to enhance container isolation and security while preserving the ability for users inside the containers to utilize BPF.

- ![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-darkblue?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white&logoSize=100&label=%20)![Assembly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tensorflow-grey?style=for-the-badge&logo=tensorflow&logoColor=white&logoSize=100&label=%20)<br>
Development of an AI model to predict glucose levels in diabetic patients based upon only the history of blood sugar measurements.

## (Some)MSc Computer Engineering Projects
- ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)![OMNeT++](https://img.shields.io/badge/OMNeT++-002244.svg?style=for-the-badge)<br>
**Design and test result analysis** of a simulation in which a network of interconnected nodes can exchange messages with each other in a peer-to-peer structure. Within this network, each node has a probability of transmitting to its neighboring nodes. The objective of the simulation is to identify the optimal configuration that maximizes the spread of the messages accounting for possible collisions. Developed in **C++** with the **OMNeT++** framework. ([Epidemic Broadcast - 2023](https://github.com/Albran99/EpidemicBroadcast))

- ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=white&&color=darkred)![OpenSSL](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenSSL-721412.svg?style=for-the-badge)<br>
Design and implementation of a **client server messaging application** with a focus on the **strong security requirements** for the network comunication. The application is modeled with a CLI interface where a user can interact with the bank server to performe transfer, check balance and history of operations. Developed in **C++** with **OpenSSL** library for both asymmetric and symmetric encryption/decryption protocols. ([Secure Bank - 2023](https://github.com/Albran99/SecureBank)) 

- ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)![Neo4j](https://img.shields.io/badge/neo4j-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=neo4j&logoColor=white)![Spring](https://img.shields.io/badge/spring-%236DB33F?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white)<br>
Design and deployment on a cluster of a full stack application for reviewing movies. The users have the opportunity to rate and review a wide range of movies, with the user base divided into two categories: critics and top critics. Critics have the option to follow top critics, ensuring they stay up-to-date with their latest opinions and insights.([Rotten Movies - 2023](https://gitlab.com/fp99/rottenmovies))

Fork of the fedlang project ([Fedlang](https://github.com/jlcorcuera/fedlang)) by Ing. Corcuera. Utilize Go for the creation of a federated learning platform, add support for switching between Golang and Python depending on user choises and additional support for user defined topologic structure of nodes ([Go-Fedlang -2024](https://github.com/glmquint/fedlang))

- ![Php](https://img.shields.io/badge/Php-darkblue?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white)<br>
SecureBank is an application designed to implement the transfer of messages and data between a client and a bank server in a secure way. The protocol designed is resistant to both replay attacks and subquantum passive ones. For simplicity purposes, it is assumed that both parties already know the other's public key ([Secure bank - 2023](https://github.com/Albran99/SecureBookWebSite))
